# Homelab

## Objective
[Brief Objective - Remove this afterwards]

This project demonstrates the creation of a cybersecurity homelab environment to simulate real-world penetration testing scenarios. 
It involves setting up interconnected Windows and Linux virtual machines, generating a custom payload using Metasploit and msfvenom, hosting it on a Python HTTP server, and testing it by executing the payload on the Windows VM.

### Skills Learned
[Bullet Points - Remove this afterwards]

- Virtualization: Set up and managed virtual machines (Windows and Linux) using a hypervisor.
- Networking: Configured and troubleshot network connections between VMs for file transfer and payload execution.
- Penetration testing: Using Nmap for reconnaisance and open port identification/Usage of msfvenom and metasploit.
- Web Hosting: Deployed a Python HTTP server to host and transfer files..
- Windows Security Bypass: Temporarily disabled Windows Defender to execute payloads.
- Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity.

### Tools Used
[Bullet Points - Remove this afterwards]

- VirtualBox/VMware setup for creating and managing the virtual environment.
- Using Nmap for network reconnaissance and open port scanning.
- Using metasploit framework to handle payload execution and exploitation.
- Netstat to observe network connections and verify successful exploitation.
